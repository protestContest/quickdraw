# QuickDraw Apps

These are some programs I've written for the classic Macintosh operating system.
I have an old Macintosh 512k I found on Craigslist, which was upgraded with a
SCSI board, 2MB RAM, and the Mac Plus ROM. With these specs, I'm sticking to
System 6.

To write the programs, I'm using Think C 5.0. To learn programming, I'm
primarily using Macintosh C Programming Primer, Vol 1, 2nd Ed by Dave Mark and
Cartwright Reed (©1992). This book helpfully also uses Think C 5. I'm also
using Inside Macintosh Vol 1–3 (©1985), which I downloaded as a PDF. It's an
essential reference.

My main goal is to create visual programs similar to sketches in [Processing][],
as well as explore graphics programming in general on old systems.

- Flying Lines: Simply taken from Mark & Reed. I used this as my starting point.
- Bounce Box: I used this simple program to write a sketch framework, which
  will continuously run `update`, and run `draw` on vertical blanking for
  smoother graphics
